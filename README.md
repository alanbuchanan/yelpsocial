# YelpSocial
### http://yelpsocial.herokuapp.com/
A small social webapp for searching bars in an area, and making a confirmation if you will be making an appearance there.

#### Tools
- **Front end**: I used the [angular-material-fullstack Yeoman generator](https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack), and a tiny bit of Bootstrap.
- **Back end**: Node.js & Express with MongoDB for storing users and confirmations. The Yelp API was accessed to gather data.

#### User Stories
- User Story: As an unauthenticated user, I can view all bars in my area.
- User Story: As an authenticated user, I can add myself to a bar to indicate I am going there tonight.
- User Story: As an authenticated user, I can remove myself from a bar if I no longer want to go there.
- (Bonus User Story: As an unauthenticated user, when I login I should not have to search again.)
